# Paid Video Call Opportunities for [Nominee Name]? (beta)

Hey [writer name],

Good news, top Hacker Noon writers can now list themselves for paid video calls via Hacker Noon’s new Meet Tech Experts Program (beta). As a Noonie nominee, I thought you may be interested in joining this program. 

If interested in receiving leads for paid video calls, [please fill out this Google Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSce_si23Kc8Ydmv27J9Z4f_BdwY5VWczKDGtZBGtUPCsbDW0Q/viewform). We’ll review the information and then if sufficient send over an invite to the Hacker Noon network via Superpeer within a week. This program is a revenue share with 75% of the earnings going to the writer and 25% going to Hacker Noon - minus the Superpeer transaction fee. Writers set their own rate and availability for all video calls. 

Meet Tech Experts by Hacker Noon is a beta marketplace. Would be great to list a talented contributor like yourself to start to stimulate supply side demand. 

Kind Regards
